 U-NO!– A Fun Uno-Inspired Web Game

# Features
🎴 Colorful UNO-like cards with textures and themed backgrounds

🤖 Play against a basic AI opponent (bot logic included)

🃏 draw/discard piles with expressive icons

🎨 Wild card color picker with UI

📱 Fully responsive and playable in modern browsers

🧠 JavaScript logic in a single self-contained file



# How to Play
--> Each player starts with 7 cards.

--> The top card from the deck is placed in the discard pile.

--> On your turn, you can play a card that matches the color or number/type of the current discard.

--> If you can't play, you must draw a card.

--> First to discard all cards wins!

# Special Cards Rules
🎨 WILD
Lets you choose the color to continue the game.

⛔ SKIP
When played, the next player loses their turn.

🔁 REVERSE
In a two-player game (you vs bot), Reverse acts like a Skip (the turn goes back to the same player).
In multiplayer, it would reverse the direction of play.
